# Phase-I-analysis-of-a-multivariate-manufacturing-data-using-Dimensionality-reduction-PCA-
The project was based on a set of data (552 samples of 209 variables) collected from a manufacturing process, in which both in-control and out-of-control data were present. The task was to develop a method or a procedure to identify the data falling in the respective categories. Since the data-set was multivariate it was key to pin-point the specifics directions to target rather than collectively studying the whole data. The techniques of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used for dimension reduction. Using Scree plot , Pareto and MDL (Minimum description length) the dimension was reduced from 209 to 9 which means 9 eigen vectors(explained 60% variation in data-set) were used to iterate the data to find in-control points. Every iteration left us with 9 univariate charts to watch out for out of control points. After 6 iteration and excluding every point that crossed the UCL , 502 points were left to set the control limits for future observation.  Tools used : R , Minitab , Excel
